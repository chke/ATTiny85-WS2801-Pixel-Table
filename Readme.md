ATTiny85 Pixel Table
====================

This is the source code of my pixel ATTiny85 Pixel Table, a table with a 7x7 pixel grid controlled by an ir remote.

Currently there are two of my remotes integrated in my code but you can use the code reader of this project to read your own codes:

The ir code is based on Nathan Chantrell's code of the TinyPCRemote

The ATTiny85 library for bitbaning the WS2801 LEDs is based on Phillip Pearson's project
